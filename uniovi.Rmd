Oviedo University is spread in three cities and seven campuses. I have used
leaflet to plot a few of its buildings.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(leaflet)

locations=as.data.frame(matrix(
c(
43.375666,-5.8296378,
43.3582776,-5.8668755,
43.3618914,-5.8598368,
43.2685906,-5.8090753,
43.5242563,-5.6289423,
43.5242563,-5.6289423)
, ncol=2,byrow = T))
colnames(locations)=c("lat","lng")

unioviIcon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = "https://lh4.ggpht.com/GtDJt3yVJrUlrHlcC0z8Gdrutl_sYiXSlZ_Yo1Mdv6Nv9IIGno0RDuTZsWxwpZZcfow",
  iconWidth = 31
)

locations %>% leaflet()  %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions,icon = unioviIcon)

```
